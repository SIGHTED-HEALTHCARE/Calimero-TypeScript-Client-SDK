# SIGHTED: Secure Information Guarding Healthcare Through Encrypted Data

**SIGHTED** is a privacy-preserving healthcare platform built on **Calimero Network** and **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**. It leverages **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** and **Calimero private shards** for secure data sharing, ensuring patients control their medical records while maintaining data privacy.

## Features
- **Privacy-Preserving Access Control**: Role-based permissions for secure data sharing.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: Verify data without revealing sensitive details.
- **Real-Time Data Updates**: Stay informed with WebSocket-based event notifications.
- **Token-Based Access Control**: Use your **ICP token** for managing access.

## Installation

Install the Calimero TypeScript Client SDK:
```bash
npm install @calimero-network/calimero-client
```

---

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-calimero-node-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLICATION_ID=your-application-id
```

---

## Quick Start

### Using RpcClient
```typescript
import { JsonRpcClient } from '@calimero-network/calimero-client';

const rpcClient = new JsonRpcClient(process.env['NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL'], '/jsonrpc');

const response = await rpcClient.execute({
  applicationId: process.env['NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLICATION_ID'],
  method: 'grant_access',
  argsJson: { userId: 'patient123', permissions: ['READ_MEDICAL_RECORD'] },
});
console.log('Access granted:', response);
```

### Using SubscriptionsClient for Real-Time Updates
```typescript
import { WsSubscriptionsClient } from '@calimero-network/calimero-client';

const wsClient = new WsSubscriptionsClient(process.env['NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL'], '/ws');

await wsClient.connect();
wsClient.subscribe([process.env['NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLICATION_ID']]);
wsClient.addCallback((event) => {
  console.log('Event received:', event);
});
```
